# This is the Only Level (Java Game) 🐘🎮

A creative platformer game built in Java, inspired by *This is the Only Level*. The game features a **single, repeating level layout**, but each stage modifies how the player interacts with it — requiring them to adapt and solve subtle variations in mechanics.

## 🧠 Concept

- One level, many twists
- Each stage uses the same map but changes behavior (e.g. reversed controls, invisible walls, altered gravity)
- The player must figure out how to beat each version of the same level

## 🎮 Features

- Java-based 2D platformer
- Keyboard controls
- Multiple game phases with logic variations
- Custom collision detection and movement physics
- Lightweight, no external libraries

## 🛠️ Installation & Run

1. Make sure **Java 8 or above** is installed
2. Open terminal inside the project folder
3. Compile all `.java` files:

```bash
javac *.java
java main
